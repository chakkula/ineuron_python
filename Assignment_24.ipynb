Of course there are exceptions, but these should truly be the exception.\n","\n","**Use good error detection and handling**. Always check return values from functions, and handle errors appropriately.\n","\n","**Use descriptive names** for variables, functions, classes. You don't want to make function and variable names too long, but they should be descriptive (e.g. use \"getRadius\" or \"get_radius\" rather than \"foo\" for a function that returns the value of the radius of a circle). Also, stick with Python-style naming conventions (e.g. i and j for loop counter variables).\n","\n","**Pick a capitalization style** for function names, local variable names, global variable names, and stick with it. For example, for function name style you could do something like \"square_the_biggest\" or \"squareTheBiggest\" or \"SquareTheBiggest\". By convention, variable names start with a lower case character.\n","\n","**Line Length**: your source code should **not** contain lines that are **longer** than **80** characters long.
